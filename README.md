# unplugged-main

This project was my first ever created responsive website. Idea and starter package provided by Skillcrush's Front-End Responsive Design course as a final project. 
The website itself is for a made-up retreat in the woods, away from the busy days and technologies for team-building purposes. Get Unplugged!
The challange lied in making the site fully responsive with at least 3 breakpoints from a PSD mockup and also two addiotional pages,
one of them including an embedded responsive map. 
I had my first breakthrough during this project and it is very close to my heart even though it is not customized,
but purely based on the mockup itself to be as pixel perfect as possible.
